State as of 14/5/17
- Two levels
- the first instantiates one of three "stars" at 0, 0, 0

- the second is a randomly generated "star-map" of star systems which is generated on start
- this dictates which stars each of the star systems will have
- this will lead on to the first level where the type of star will be spawned


PLANNED

- player will control a fleet of warships
- fleet transit of star systems will take days
- max speed possible for travel will be 0.2 light speed (to scale)
- max engagement speed will be a relative speed of 0.2 light speed
  - if two fleets moving at each other, both travelling 0.1 light, their relative speed would be 0.2 light
- fleet logistics will need to be managed (i.e. fuel cells, expendable ammunition, food etc)
  
MOVE COMING SOON
